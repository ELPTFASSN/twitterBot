# twitterBot v 1.2 ðŸ¤–
A Twitter Bot made by me using Python and some its libriaries.

-----------------------------------------------------
REQUIREMENTS ðŸ“£
-----------------------------------------------------

- Mozilla Firefox

- Python 

- geckodriver https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases

- It works only with desktop-type Twitter website window

-------------------------------------------------
DESCRIPTION ðŸ”¦ 
-------------------------------------------------

It uses selenium, time, random, datetime, getopt, sqlite3, os and sys libraries.

It tries to login with an email and a password on Twitter. If credentials are correct, It looks into the database if that user logged in yet and so if There is a record with that username id.
If there isn't that record, It creates it.
If the credentials aren't correct, throws an error.
You can decide if search for some hashtag/hashtags as input and It will looks for
some tweets searching those words in the search input field.
Instead you can crawl the tweets present in your Home.
The tweets links listed in the result pages are copied in a unique list X.
The elements of this X list are shuffled and then It starts to search those tweets.
Surely It presses the heart button on all of those, then It maybe retweets them.

Why maybe?

Because It only retweets the ~50% of all tweets reached (but puts likes on all).

Why ~50% and not exactly 50%?

Because for little numbers of hashtags or less trending hashtags or hashtags with low content (so the captured links < 30-40) It retweets about 40-65% of all tweets reached.
Instead for big numbers of hashtags or most trending hashtags or hashtags with high content (so the captured links > 80-90) It's more precise and almost exactly retweets 50% of them (with a low error like 2-3%).

When It finish, It stores all the likes and retweets count in a SQLite3 database called database.db
